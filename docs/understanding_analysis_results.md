## 3. Key Prediction Drivers

This section lists the most influential factors driving the model's predictions. Each factor is accompanied by a brief description of its importance.

### Example:
```
üîç WHAT DRIVES MSFT PREDICTIONS:
  The model focuses on these key factors:
    1. Distance from 52-week resistance level
       üìç Minor factor for MSFT predictions
    2. obv_sma_12 (technical indicator)
       üìç Minor factor for MSFT predictions
    3. price_position_12w (technical indicator)
       üìç Minor factor for MSFT predictions
    4. volatility_26w (technical indicator)
       üìç Minor factor for MSFT predictions
    5. support_26w (technical indicator)
       üìç Minor factor for MSFT predictions
```

### Technical Indicator Descriptions:

#### **1. Distance from 52-week Resistance Level**
- **Definition**: The difference between the current stock price and its highest price over the past 52 weeks.
- **Purpose**: Indicates how close the stock is to its resistance level, which is a price point where selling pressure might increase, potentially preventing further price rises.
- **Interpretation**:
  - A small distance suggests the stock is near its resistance level, which could signal a potential reversal or breakout.
  - A large distance indicates room for upward movement before hitting resistance.

#### **2. OBV_SMA_12 (On-Balance Volume with 12-Period Simple Moving Average)**
- **Definition**: OBV is a momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict price changes. OBV_SMA_12 smooths the OBV over a 12-period simple moving average.
- **Purpose**: Helps identify the strength of a trend by analyzing volume.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Rising OBV_SMA_12 suggests strong buying pressure, supporting an upward trend.
  - Falling OBV_SMA_12 indicates selling pressure, signaling a potential downtrend.

#### **3. Price_Position_12w**
- **Definition**: The relative position of the current price within its range over the past 12 weeks.
- **Purpose**: Measures where the stock price stands in its recent trading range.
- **Interpretation**:
  - A value near 1 indicates the price is at the top of its range (potential resistance).
  - A value near 0 suggests the price is at the bottom of its range (potential support).

#### **4. Volatility_26w**
- **Definition**: The standard deviation of the stock's returns over the past 26 weeks.
- **Purpose**: Measures the stock's price fluctuations over time.
- **Interpretation**:
  - High volatility indicates larger price swings, which may suggest higher risk and potential reward.
  - Low volatility suggests more stable price movements, which may appeal to risk-averse investors.

#### **5. Support_26w**
- **Definition**: The lowest price level the stock has reached over the past 26 weeks, where buying pressure has historically been strong enough to prevent further price declines.
- **Purpose**: Identifies potential price levels where the stock might find support.
- **Interpretation**:
  - If the stock approaches its support level, it may rebound upward.
  - A break below the support level could signal further declines.
