- **Feature categories**: Momentum indicators are highly predictive, volatility measures crucial for risk assessment
- **Investment implications**: Trend-following strategies may be effective, volume confirmation valuable

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- **uv** (fast Python package manager) - [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Internet connection for data download

### Setup and Run
```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or: brew install uv

# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd stock-trends

# Setup environment and run complete pipeline (using uv)
make setup
make all
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)

The project works without API keys but with limited functionality. For full features, configure these APIs:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys (get them for free):
# - FRED_API_KEY: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
# - FINNHUB_API_KEY: https://finnhub.io/register
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `FRED_API_KEY` - Federal Reserve Economic Data API (macroeconomic indicators)
- `FINNHUB_API_KEY` - Finnhub Stock API (financial news data)

**What happens without API keys:**
- **Still works**: Stock price data (yfinance), technical analysis, model training, backtesting
- **Limited**: No macroeconomic data (GDP, inflation) or financial news sentiment

**Rate Limits (Free Tiers):**
- FRED API: 120 requests/minute
- Finnhub API: 60 requests/minute

### Alternative CLI Usage
```bash
# Direct CLI commands (recommended - ensures correct environment)
uv run cli.py validate    # Validate setup
uv run cli.py all          # Run complete pipeline
uv run cli.py models       # Train models only
uv run cli.py explain      # Generate explainability reports

# Make commands - two approaches:
make all                  # Traditional: individual scripts with Make orchestration  
make cli-all              # Modern: unified CLI with integrated error handling

# Other Make commands
make validate             # Same as: uv run cli.py validate
make cli-validate         # Same as: uv run cli.py validate (unified interface)
```

## How to Use This Tool

### What This Tool Does
This tool predicts **12-week forward stock returns** using machine learning models trained on technical analysis indicators. It helps you:

1. **Identify trending stocks** - Find stocks likely to move up or down over the next 3 months
2. **Understand why predictions work** - SHAP analysis explains which technical indicators drive predictions
3. **Validate trading strategies** - Realistic backtesting with transaction costs and slippage
4. **Compare ML approaches** - LightGBM vs Transformer models with performance metrics

### Input: What You Provide

### Step-by-Step Usage Guide

#### Step 1: Complete Pipeline (Recommended First Run)
```bash
# Option A: Traditional Make approach (fine-grained control)
make all
# Runs individual scripts: setup → data → features → models → backtest → explainability
# Good for: debugging specific steps, development workflow

# Option B: Unified CLI approach (integrated error handling)  
make cli-all
# Runs unified pipeline: uv run cli.py all
# Good for: production runs, consistent logging, progress tracking

# Both take: 15-30 minutes depending on number of stocks and internet speed
# Both produce identical results - choose based on your workflow preference
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Results
```bash
# Check what was generated
ls reports/           # Analysis reports and visualizations
ls models/           # Trained models and performance metrics

# Key files to examine:
# - reports/model_comparison.json    # Performance comparison
# - reports/feature_importance.png   # Which indicators matter most
# - reports/shap_analysis.png        # Prediction explanations
# - reports/backtest_results.json    # Trading simulation results
```

#### Step 3: Interpret Predictions
```python
# Example: Reading model predictions
import json

# Load performance comparison
with open('models/model_comparison.json') as f:
    comparison = json.load(f)
    
print(f"Best model: {comparison['best_model']['name']}")
print(f"Test RMSE: {comparison['best_model']['test_rmse']:.4f}")
print(f"Directional accuracy: {comparison['best_model']['directional_accuracy']:.1%}")

# Load individual stock predictions (if available)
with open('reports/stock_predictions.json') as f:
    predictions = json.load(f)
    
for stock, pred in predictions.items():
    direction = "UP" if pred['predicted_return'] > 0.02 else "DOWN" if pred['predicted_return'] < -0.02 else "HOLD"
    print(f"{stock}: {direction} ({pred['predicted_return']:+.1%} predicted return)")
```

#### Step 4: Customize for Your Use Case

**A. Analyze Different Stocks**
```bash
# Method 1: Use CLI ticker management
uv run cli.py tickers update --set YOUR STOCKS HERE

# Method 2: Use Make ticker commands
make tickers-list         # View current stocks
make tickers-defaults     # See all 40 S&P 500 options
make tickers-reset        # Reset to all defaults
# Or: uv run cli.py tickers update --add NVDA AMD INTC

# Then re-run pipeline with new stocks
make data features models  # Traditional approach
# Or: make cli-all         # Unified approach (full pipeline)
```

**B. Adjust Prediction Horizon**
```bash
# Edit src/features/feature_engineering.py
# Change TARGET_HORIZON = 8  # For 8-week predictions instead of 12
make features models       # Re-train with new horizon
```

**C. Focus on Specific Analysis**
```bash
make models     # Only train models (skip data download)
make explain    # Only generate explainability reports
make backtest   # Only run trading simulation
```

### Real-World Application Examples

```bash
# 1. Run pipeline on your watchlist
# 2. Check reports/stock_predictions.json for top-ranked stocks
# 3. Use SHAP analysis to understand why certain stocks are predicted to rise
# 4. Consider position sizing based on prediction confidence
```

#### Example 2: Strategy Validation
```bash
# 1. Backtest results show historical performance
# 2. Compare model predictions vs buy-and-hold
# 3. Analyze transaction costs impact on returns
# 4. Use feature importance to refine your manual analysis
```

#### Example 3: Research and Education
```bash
# 1. Understand which technical indicators actually predict returns
# 2. Compare tree-based (LightGBM) vs neural network (Transformer) approaches

## Configuration

### Ticker Configuration
The project uses a file-based ticker configuration system:

- **`config/tickers.example.txt`** - Template file (committed to git)
- **`config/tickers.txt`** - Your personal configuration (gitignored)

When you first run the project, `config/tickers.txt` is automatically created from the example file. You can then customize it without affecting version control.

**Managing your ticker list:**
```bash
# View current tickers
make tickers-list

# Edit with CLI
uv run cli.py tickers update --set AAPL MSFT GOOGL

# Or edit the file directly
vim config/tickers.txt
```

### Model Parameters
- **LightGBM**: Learning rate 0.05, early stopping after 100 rounds
- **Transformer**: 6 layers, 8 attention heads, 128 hidden dimensions
- **Training**: 5 walk-forward splits, 12-week prediction horizon

### Trading Parameters  
- **Transaction Costs**: 0.128% total (commission + spread + impact + slippage)
- **Position Sizing**: Max 5% per position, 15% volatility target
- **Rebalancing**: Weekly with 12-week holding period

## Dependencies

**Package Manager**: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (fast, reliable Python package manager)

Core libraries managed by uv:
- `pandas`, `numpy` - Data manipulation
- `lightgbm` - Gradient boosting
- `torch`, `transformers` - Neural networks  
- `scikit-learn` - ML utilities
- `yfinance` - Data download
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Visualization
- `shap` - Model explainability
- `pytest` - Testing

All dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock` for reproducible builds.

**Why no requirements.txt?** Modern Python projects use `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` instead:
- `pyproject.toml` - Human-readable dependency specification  
- `uv.lock` - Exact versions for reproducible builds (auto-generated)
- Much faster and more reliable than the old pip + requirements.txt approach

## Development

### Code Quality
```bash
make lint     # Code quality checks
make format   # Auto-format code
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem: "uv is not installed" error**
```bash
# Solution: Install uv first
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or: brew install uv
# Then restart your terminal
```

**Problem: Data download fails or is very slow**
```bash
# Solution 1: Check internet connection and retry
make clean && make data

# Solution 2: Reduce stock list for testing
make tickers-list                    # See current stocks
uv run cli.py tickers update --set AAPL MSFT  # Use just 2 stocks for testing
# Or: make tickers-reset && uv run cli.py tickers update --set AAPL MSFT
```

**Problem: Model training takes too long**
```bash
# Solution 1: Use CPU-only for faster setup
# Edit src/models/train_transformer.py, set device='cpu'

# Solution 2: Train only one model type
make setup
uv run src/models/train_lightgbm.py  # Fast gradient boosting only
```

**Problem: "Permission denied" or file access errors**
```bash
# Solution: Check file permissions and available disk space
df -h  # Check disk space
```

**Problem: Missing dependencies or import errors**
```bash
# Solution: Re-sync environment
make clean
make setup
uv run cli.py validate  # Should show all green checkmarks
```

**Problem: API rate limits (with API keys configured)**
```bash
# Solution: The tool automatically handles rate limits, but if you see errors:
# - FRED API: Wait 1 minute between runs
# - Finnhub API: Wait 1 minute between runs
# - Or run without API keys (limited features but fully functional)
```

**Problem: Predictions seem unrealistic**
```bash
# Solution: This is normal! Remember:
# - Stock prediction is inherently uncertain
# - Models predict probabilities, not certainties
# - Check model confidence in reports/model_comparison.json
# - Directional accuracy >60% is considered good
```

### Getting Help

1. **Validate setup**: `uv run cli.py validate` should pass all checks
2. **Check logs**: Error messages usually indicate the specific issue
3. **Start simple**: Try with just 2-3 stocks first
4. **Review documentation**: Each module has detailed docstrings
5. **Check disk space**: Pipeline generates ~1-2GB of data and models
